# sustainable-fashion-hub

If you’re into fashion but uncomfortable with the fact it can have a high environmental cost, this new shopping site might be just what you’re looking for.

Project Cece, which stands for Project Conscious Clothing, was founded by three women in Amsterdam who want to make finding sustainable clothing easier.

The site has scoured eco-conscious fashion suppliers to find the best of the bunch – and it categorises clothes to suit different tastes. You can filter clothes to be vegan, fair trade, locally produced (in Europe) and “made for a good cause”. Think of it as a hub of sustainable shopping brands.

“The fashion industry is one of the most polluting industries in the world that also exploits millions of people,” the company states. “In addition, the clothing industry causes an enormous amount of water wastage, CO2 emissions, and the pollution of soil, rivers and oceans.”
